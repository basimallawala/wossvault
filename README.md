## FAQ

### How do I add my own former assessments?
go to the "issues" tab, and create a new issue (the big green button in the top right). On the very right of the page, add a "submit" label. Then, DM @basimallawala on Instagram to figure out a time and place to hand over the tests, where they will be scanned and added.

### How do I request a course's assessments?
go to the "issues" tab, and create a new issue (the big green button in the top right). On the very right of the page, add a "request" label. Make the title the course code you'd like, in all caps. Add any notes in the "description" label.
